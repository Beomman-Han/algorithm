## Brute-Force

Algorithm that try all possible cases in a specific problem.

Pros) Brute-force method is intuitive, clear, and finds a solution definitely.

Cons) It is very inefficient especially big size of input.

But it is the starting point for more efficient algorithm.

When we encounter complex problems, think with brute-force method firstly.
